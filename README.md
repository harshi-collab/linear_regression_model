🚗 Car Purchase Amount Prediction – Regression Analysis Project

Completed an end-to-end regression analysis project to predict car purchasing amounts using customer financial and demographic data.

🔑 Key Highlights

Cleaned and prepared real-world data for modeling

Performed correlation analysis using heatmaps to understand feature relationships

Applied feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

Built and compared Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models

Evaluated model performance using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualized Actual vs Predicted values to assess model accuracy

📈 Learning Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of the complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and highlighted the importance of regularization techniques in improving model performance and reducing overfitting.
